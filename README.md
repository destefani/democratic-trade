# Democratic Trade

Democratic countries should change their economic relationships towards authoritarian ruled countries. 

Countries like Russia and China are important trade partners with a lot of western democratic countries, even though they are ruled by authoritarian regimes. This countries have openly showed their willingness to invade countries and impose their rules to sovereign  democratic countries. 

The most concrete example is the invasion of Russia of Ukraine, first annexing Crimea and now with a full-scale invasion of the country. But also China taking control of Honk-Kong and menacing to do the same with Taiwan.

China has grown to become a major economic power in the world, in a large proportion by trading with democratic western countries. 

In a way western countries are major partners of this regimes.

The objective of this analysis is to asses the economical impact that democratic western countries would have if they would not trade with authoritarian regimes. What are the goods exported/imported to/from authoritarian countries? Can we substitute these goods with goods from democratic countries?
